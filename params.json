The idea is that many of these style presentations are based on trees or graphs and R already has very good tools for coming up with different layouts for these trees.\r\n\r\n## Tabs\r\n### Graph\r\nShows the graph rendering itself using the built-in plot.igraph function, it is pretty boring, but shows the general layout.\r\n\r\n### Slides\r\nShows the presentation itself in an iframe. Some browsers do not like this, in which case just use the source in the next panel.\r\n\r\n### Source\r\nThe source code for the presentation, since the iframe ```srcdoc```, makes it pretty un-readable. The formatting is ugly, if I find a pretty.html function somewhere, I'll use it.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\nThis project took advantage of the great tools developed at \r\n- http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home\r\n- http://wmh.github.io/circular-slides-generator/\r\n- and of course the RStudio Shiny documentation\r\n","google":"UA-48764461-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
